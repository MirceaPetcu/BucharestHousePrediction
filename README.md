I implemented a model to predict the price of an apartment in Bucharest based on the number of rooms, area, floor level, total number of floors in the building, the sector it’s located in, and the location score. The data was sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denisadutca/bucharest-house-price-dataset, which specifies that it was collected in March 2019 from the site www.imobiliare.com.

I started by visualizing how correlated the feature columns are with the target column (Apartment Price). From the generated heatmap, I noticed that the variables 'Floor' and 'Total Floors' are very weakly correlated, while 'Sector' and 'Score' are not correlated at all with the target variable. For this reason, I will remove them to avoid making the model overly complex (to prevent overfitting, especially with a large model).

To run the model, I transform categorical data into numerical data so that the algorithm can process it. For the linear model, I bring the data in the 'Area' column to a standard normal distribution for better predictions (since linear regression uses a function for prediction, the data should ideally be more linear). I remove extreme outliers (those more than 3 * standard deviations from the mean) for better model performance. I apply three algorithms: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and KNN for regression. I observe that the KNN and polynomial models perform best. I optimize the hyperparameters using GridSearch with Cross-Validation, as these parameters cannot be refined during the learning process. I split the training set into 6 parts and test the model on each parameter combination.

I observe that the polynomial model performs slightly better and select it, with a function degree of 2, as the most suitable model for this problem. I achieve an R² score (the ratio between predicted and true values) of 0.6513.
